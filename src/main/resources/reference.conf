    # IMPORTANT: The first thread ["subscriptions"] is dedicated to the Subscriptions EventProcessor.
    # This thread is created at engine startup and is NOT available for configuration with other dispatchers.
    # However, other threads CAN use the "subscriptions" dispatcher via configuration if needed.

    #   ["subscriptions"],    # Dedicated subscriptions thread (required)

    # thread-dispatcher-assignment = [
    #   ["subscriptions"],    # Dedicated subscriptions thread (required)
    #   ["api", "realtime"],  # Thread 1 handles api and realtime
